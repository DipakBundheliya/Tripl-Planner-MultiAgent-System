Multi-Agent Travel Planning System


Overview :
This project is a Multi-Agent System (MAS) built for automated travel planning using CrewAI. It utilizes four intelligent agents that work collaboratively to create an optimal, budget-friendly travel plan. Each agent is specialized in a different aspect of the travel planning process:

Flight Search Agent – Searches for flights based on user preferences.

Hotel Search Agent – Finds hotels based on user location and budget.

Activity Search Agent – Recommends activities based on destination and interests.

Final Agent – Aggregates the results from all agents and creates a concrete, budget-friendly travel plan for the user.


Features :
Flight Search: Finds flights based on destination, dates, and budget constraints.

Hotel Search: Searches for hotels that fit the user's preferences, location, and price range.

Activity Search: Provides activities and events based on the destination.

Budget-Friendly Travel Plan: Combines all results into a personalized, cost-effective travel plan.
